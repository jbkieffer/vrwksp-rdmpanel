## Research Data Management Panel

Friday, June 7, 2019; 9:00 - 10:15 am CDT (75 minutes)

### Panelists
- Jamene Brooks-Kieffer, University of Kansas (moderator)
- Vas Vasiliadis, Globus
- Jen Zhao, Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute
- Mara Sedlins, Colorado State University
- Megan O'Donnell, Iowa State University
- Pete Schlax, Bates College

## Panel Outline

### Introductions (5 minutes)

Panelist round robin; <= 1 min each.

Introduce yourself: Name, institution, title (if you want), and one sentence about what you do in your current position.

As moderator, Jamene will also briefly introduce the concept of Research Data Management.

### Panelists Round 1 (up to 20 minutes) - Local Contexts for Research Data Management

Round robin; ~ 3 min each.

Describe one or two services or programs you facilitate or assist with in the area of Research Data Management (RDM).

### Q&A / Discussion Round 1 (up to 15 minutes)

Open floor for learners' questions, comments, and discussion. Don't let one person monopolize. If necessary, prompt with a question to the learners:

- "Where have you already encountered the need for RDM in the work that you do?"

If silence persists, follow-up questions or comments among panelists about Round 1.

### Panelists Round 2 (up to 20 minutes) - Beyond Local Research Data Management

Round robin; ~ 3 min each

This is the space for broader RDM-related topics from the panelists; some of these were discussed over email (and are my best guess RE: your intentions) but aren't set in stone.

- Jamene: recognizing and cultivating intentionality across differing priorities
- Jen: training citizen scientists in RDM
- Vas: automating workflows & RDM at scale
- Mara: TBD
- Megan: facilitating data as a first class research object (i.e. worthy of publication)
- Pete: TBD

One of the panelists who pulled out had suggested, "How do we as folks who help with RDM perform assessment and show how we add value to the process?" Assessment is a great concept to add here if anyone wants to take it on and may be a good kick-off for the second round of Q&A / discussion.

### Q&A / Discussion Round 2 (up to 15 minutes)

Open floor for learners' questions, comments, and discussion. Don't let one person monopolize. If silence persists, prompt with questions such as:

- "How will you translate RDM needs and requirements between researchers and HPC specialists?"
- "What is your plan for identifying RDM specialists at your organization and communicating with them?"
- "What have you been surprised to discover that your researchers **don't** know about RDM?" (from HN)
- "What are the key issues that you've seen work well to get your researchers to pursue RDM and/or to collaborate with you on RDM? What brings them in the door?" (from HN)
